# Polynomial Solver Web Application

This project is a web-based polynomial solver built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It demonstrates polynomial interpolation and evaluation based on user-provided data points.

## Features

- Add, edit, import, and export polynomial roots (data points).
- Decode y-values encoded in various numeric bases.
- Compute polynomial coefficients via Lagrange interpolation.
- Evaluate polynomial values at custom inputs.
- Clean and responsive UI with modern styling.

## Technology Stack

- React with TypeScript
- Vite for fast development and building
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- shadcn-ui component library for reusable UI elements
- lucide-react icons API integration


## Usage

- Input polynomial roots manually or via JSON file import.
- The app decodes the roots and calculates the polynomial coefficients.
- View the polynomial equation.
- Evaluate the polynomial at any x-value.
- Export your data for future use.


The static files will be generated in the `dist` folder and can be deployed to any static hosting service.
